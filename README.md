# nerdy_data_stuff
This repo houses my solutions to programming exercises assigned to me as part of the masters of science in data science program at the University of Denver
as  well as solutions to exercises completed during my undergraduate studies in computer information systems at Metropolitan State University of Denver. My repo isn't to up to date right now cause I've been busy, but keep checking back you never know when I may add something cool.
